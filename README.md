Getting Started
Below are suggested installation and usage instructions. You may need to update paths or names depending on local setup.
Prerequisites
.NET SDK (version matching the solution configuration, e.g. .NET Core or .NET Framework—check the .sln file)
An IDE or editor that supports C# (e.g. Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code with C# plugin)
Installation
Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/paul-bogdan/PipelineExecutor.git
cd PipelineExecutor
Open the solution file PipelineExecutor.sln in your IDE.
Build the solution. All projects should compile (core library + demo).
Usage
Inspect the PipelineExecutorDemo project for example code. This should show how to use the core library.
In your project, reference the PipelineExecutor library (project reference or via compiled DLL).
Define pipelines using the types / interfaces provided (e.g. tasks, operations, stages), then execute them through the executor.
(Optional) For more advanced use, extend/customize task types, error handling, logging, etc.
