# PipelineExecutor

## Overview
**PipelineExecutor** is a C# solution designed to facilitate executing pipelines of tasks (or operations) in a controlled manner.  
It includes a demo project (`PipelineExecutorDemo`), which likely showcases how you can build and run pipelines using the core library (`PipelineExecutor`).

## Getting Started

Below are suggested installation and usage instructions. You may need to update paths or names depending on your setup.

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (version matching the solution configuration, e.g., .NET Core or .NET Framework â€” check the `.sln` file).  
- An IDE or editor that supports C# (e.g., Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code with C# plugin).  

## Usage

1. Inspect the `PipelineExecutorDemo` project for example code â€” this demonstrates how to use the core library.  
2. In your own project, reference the `PipelineExecutor` library (as a project reference or via compiled DLL).  
3. Define pipelines using the provided types/interfaces (e.g., tasks, operations, stages).  
4. Execute them through the executor.  
5. *(Optional)* Extend/customize task types, error handling, logging, etc.  


### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/paul-bogdan/PipelineExecutor.git
cd PipelineExecutor
```
## Contributing

## Possible Enhancements

Here are some ideas that might make the project more useful and robust:

- Add documentation of the pipeline API (interfaces, task definitions, error handling, concurrency handling).  
- Add unit/integration tests.  
- Add logging and monitoring of pipeline progress.  
- Support more advanced features such as branching, conditional steps, retry logic, and cancellation.
